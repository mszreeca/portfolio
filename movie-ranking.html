<h3>Orion and the Dark</h3>
<p>These are the main messages from Orion and the Dark: Fear is a natural emotion and a part of life.

It's important to find your inner worth and to know your true value, regardless of how others perceive you.</p>
<h3>Turning Red</h3>
<p>The movie says it best: “People have all kinds of sides to them, Mei, and some sides are messy.” You don't have to follow in your parent's footsteps. You don't exist to please others.
